# n8n-nodes-blockfrost

This is a custom n8n node for interacting with the [Cardano blockchain](https://cardano.org) via the [Blockfrost API](https://blockfrost.io).

## Features

- Query Cardano blockchain data (accounts, addresses, transactions, blocks, etc.)
- Work with NFTs and native tokens
- Access IPFS data (if supported by your Blockfrost project)
- Integrate Cardano blockchain data into your n8n workflows

## Installation

### Option 1: Community Node (via npm)

1. Open your n8n instance
2. Go to **Settings** > **Community Nodes**
3. Click **Install**
4. Enter `n8n-nodes-blockfrost` and click **Install**

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Navigate to your n8n custom directory: `~/.n8n/custom/`
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/bevanamit/n8n-nodes-blockfrost.git`
3. Install dependencies: `cd n8n-nodes-blockfrost && npm install`
4. Build the project: `npm run build`
5. Restart n8n

### Option 3: Fail-Safe Installation (if npm install does not work as expected)

If running `npm install n8n-nodes-blockfrost` in your `~/.n8n/custom/` directory does not install the package correctly, try the following steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your n8n custom directory:
   ```
   cd ~/.n8n/custom
   ```
2. Initialize a package.json if it does not exist:
   ```
   npm init -y
   ```
3. Install the package:
   ```
   npm install n8n-nodes-blockfrost
   ```
4. Restart n8n completely (stop and start the process).

This ensures the package and its dependencies are installed correctly and n8n can load the custom node.

## Prerequisites

- [n8n](https://n8n.io/) (version 0.209.0 or newer)

   - Select the network:
     - **Cardano Mainnet**: For production use
     - **Cardano Preprod**: For testing on the preprod testnet
     - **Cardano Preview**: For testing on the preview testnet

3. **Get Your Project ID**:
   - After creating your project, you'll be shown your Project ID
   - This ID will look something like `mainnet1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j`
   - Copy this ID to use in your n8n Blockfrost node credentials

4. **Free Tier Information**:
   - Blockfrost offers a free tier with 50,000 requests per day
